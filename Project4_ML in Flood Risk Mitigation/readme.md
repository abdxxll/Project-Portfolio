# Securing Tomorrow: Machine Learning in Flood Risk Mitigation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview of the Business Problem

Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters, currently threatening **1.47 billion people worldwide**, with particularly severe impacts in low- and middle-income countries where resilience infrastructure is limited. This project explores how **machine learning models can enhance flood risk prediction and mitigation**, enabling governments and emergency response agencies to protect communities, allocate resources efficiently, and reduce economic losses.

## ðŸ›  Methodology

Our team applied a structured data science and machine learning pipeline:

* **Problem Framing**: Defined flood occurrence as a **binary classification problem (Yes/No)**.
* **Data Selection**: Used meteorological and environmental variables including rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, climate change index, urbanization levels, soil quality, and river discharge.
* **Models Tested**:

  * Logistic Regression (baseline)
  * Decision Trees
  * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  * Neural Networks (deep learning for spatial-temporal dynamics)
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC.
* **Feature Correlation Analysis**: Identified relationships between climate change, urbanization, dam quality, disaster preparedness, and flood likelihood.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings

* **Strong Predictors**: Climate Change Index and Urbanization are highly correlated with flood occurrence.
* **Mitigating Factors**: Dam Quality and Disaster Preparedness reduce flood risks.
* **Complex Drivers**: Deforestation, siltation, and coastal vulnerabilities contribute to flood severity.
* **Model Reliability**: Neural networks offer the best potential for capturing complex spatial-temporal flood dynamics.

## ðŸ’¡ Business Impact

* **Public Safety**: Supports proactive evacuation and disaster preparedness.
* **Resource Allocation**: Enables smarter deployment of emergency services and infrastructure investment.
* **Economic Resilience**: Mitigates financial losses in industries such as agriculture, insurance, logistics, and real estate.
* **Policy Support**: Provides evidence-based insights for governments to design flood management strategies.
* **Community Resilience**: Enhances preparedness in high-risk regions, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh.

## ðŸ™‹ My Role and Contribution

* Evaluate existing data for the problem at hand and synthesize additional necessary parameters based on stakeholder suggestions. 
* Contributed to **data feature identification** and alignment with environmental factors (climate change, urbanization, dam quality).
* Helped design the **machine learning experiment setup**, including classification framing and evaluation metrics.
* Co-developed insights linking model outputs to **business and policy impacts**.
* Assisted in building the **presentation narrative** connecting technical results to stakeholder value.

## ðŸš€ Future Opportunities

* Extend lead time of flood predictions up to **five days in ungauged basins**.
* Integrate the model into **real-time public early warning systems**, accessible across 80+ countries.
* Scale forecasting capabilities to **support global disaster preparedness** with free and open access.
