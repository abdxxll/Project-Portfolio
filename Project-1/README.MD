## 🛠 Business Problem
Yelp reviews influence consumer decisions and business reputations, yet not all reviews provide the same level of value.  
We aimed to answer:
- **What makes a review useful?** (text, sentiment, structure)  
- **What can Arizona businesses learn** from top-voted useful reviews?  
- **How can Yelp benefit** from enhancing ranking algorithms with these insights?  

---

## 📈 Methodology
Our approach combined **linguistic analysis**, **feature engineering**, and **sentiment modeling**:
1. **Data Collection** – 83,325 Yelp reviews with ≥10 “useful” votes.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Structural metrics (word/paragraph counts, punctuation), readability scores, sentiment polarity & subjectivity.  
4. **Topic Modeling** – Identifying content elements and themes associated with usefulness.  
5. **Correlation Analysis** – Linking features to review usefulness scores.

## 💡 Key Findings
- **Neutral and mixed sentiment reviews** are rated most useful; extreme reviews are less impactful.  
- **Structure matters**:  
  - Reviews with **3+ paragraphs** received 96% more usefulness votes.  
  - Reviews with **clear conclusions** were 72% more impactful.  
  - **Organized formats** (lists, bullet points) and structured reviews (score 7+) gained 4x more votes.  
- **Readability matters**: Mid-level readability and clear storytelling improved engagement.
